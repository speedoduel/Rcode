# Rcode, This contains my First R group project for DATA 100 and my ST 259 Lab R tutorials file 
### This was a combined group efforts with 5 group members involved all of us were provided a clean and balanced data set with world population and other features and we were supposed to bring insights and produce a reasoning as to why some countries have higher happiness index when compared to others based on external factors

#### Here is a brief summary of my contribution in this project
Importing data sets. Tidying all the data sets (parsing variables into wanted types). Using ggplot to plot graphs and create insights from it then combining work with the data sets used by my work. Plottiing graphs with trend lines and finding correlation between different variables. Going in depth in a compairison - coputing the p values the relation between the residuals and the standerdized errors and other such factors, also computing the levarage value as well as the R^2 values to check the accuracy of the model on an overall basis which helped landing onto some good conclusions proving that those conclusions were somewhat accurate, performing regression and using trend line in many data sets to see how the line of best fit goes and what's the general trend in the data, plotting out the relation between the residuals and our given variables to get deeper insights. Finding the confidence interval. Relating different parts of the project and factors analysed between one another. Drawing joint conclusions from all parts of the project. Using: ggplot() corr() inner_join() predict() filter() hatvalues() summary() lm() parse_number() which.max()  lm.fit() mutate() plot() log2() confirnt()
